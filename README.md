# Petals Around The Rose

Simple program for playing Petals Around The Rose. When the game starts you 
will be shown 5 dice and an answer. The objective of the game is to figure out
how the answer is related to the values on the faces of the dice.

Obviously the answer is in the source code, so I'm not going to explain it 
here. If you're really stuck, crack open `src/petals.c` to see what is going
on.
